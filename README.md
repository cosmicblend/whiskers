# Welcome to Whiskers
v0.8 Alpha May, 2012

Greetings. Whiskers is here to make your make your social network a little more beautiful and a little more safe.

## What Is Whiskers?

Whiskers is your self-hosted social media home base. Once set up and linked to supported social media accounts, you can use it to efficiently post updates to those accounts.

## More Beautiful?

Automated cross-posting is the [bacon](http://www.theatlanticwire.com/technology/2011/03/chart-day-spam-or-bacon/36021/) - or, sadly, sometimes the spam - of our social networks. It's awkward and impersonal, and it conveys the attitude that you really just don't care.

Whiskers can and will tailor format each of your updates to post to the specific services you choose. It can put an end to those ugly duplicate check in notices and inappropriate #fb hash tags. Instead your friends, family, and stalkers will feel truly considered when they read your updates rippling out across the graph.

## More Safe, Too?

Each post you make will be saved locally so you have an historical backup of your social media content. Social services come, go, or get acquired but the record of your personal or organization's history shouldn't. You will always have the authoritative version and variations of you post.

## Great! How Do I Start Using It Right Now?

At alpha, Whiskers demonstrates the concept more than the full potential utility. Architecturally it is ready to add integration plugins for other services. The interface allows for a seed post to be written and quickly customized for each enabled social media channel.

## Installation

- Clone the repository: $ git clone --recursive git@github.com:whiskersapp/whiskersapp.git
- Drop whiskers in the web root of an existing site or set up a Virtual Host pointing to the installation.
- Go to http://install.root/whiskersapp/

## Support
As an alpha release, Whiskers is not officially supported and only suitable for use by developers. If you fix a bug, submit a patch!

## Todo
* Integration with the Locker Project would be nice to collect historical social media posts or activity through other clients, making Whiskers a more comprehensive backup while the interface takes shape.
* New posting types for photos, links and locations. Interface designs for these items are included in the project documentation.
* Further outline API
* Make Whiskers RESTful
* Proper token authentication system or OpenID/OAuth server
* Publish basic iOS app
* Hack and play. We have some ideas where Whiskers can go, but we can't think of it all. Take it, use it, change it, share it.
